Metric Learning for Cluster Analysis (MLCA) - CVPR 2016

This is a Beta version for the code of our CVPR 2016 paper: Closed-Form Training of Mahalanobis Distance for Supervised Clustering.
The MATLAB script demo.m gives an instance of how this code is meant to be used, generating a toy example which can be used as a proof of concept. 
The provided code corresponds to the toy experiment reported in Table 2 of our paper. 
- If you set the "noisy" parameter to false, it corresponds to the toy experiment reported in Table 3.
- If you set the "same_cluster_size" parameter to true (while keeping "noisy" set to true), it corresponds to the toy experiment reported in Table 1.
